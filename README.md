# Big bug I've faced:    
- Hydration: 
    -> Solution: Find the place where I misuse the HTML rules (for example h3 cannot be placed outside of h6)
- Contentful API fetching, and using image from Contentful
    -> Solution: Read the doc about Contentful
- Responsive design
    -> Solution: TailwindCSS is already written to serve mobile first approach, so calm down and make the code "from the small up"
